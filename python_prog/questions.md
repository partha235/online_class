Here are 10 Python questions that use `if`, `if-else`, `elif`, `for`, uppercase/lowercase conversion, and input type conversion:

**1. Vowel Checker:**
   - Write a Python program that takes a character as input (using `input()`) and checks if it's a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) using `if` statements. Consider both uppercase and lowercase letters (convert input to lowercase using `lower()`).

**2. Number Sign Check:**
   - Write a program that takes a number as input (use `int(input())`) and checks if it's positive, negative, or zero using `if-else` statements.

**3. Leap Year:**
   - Create a program that takes a year as input and determines if it's a leap year using `if-else` and `elif` statements. Consider the divisibility rules for leap years.

**4. Password Strength:**
   - Write a program that takes a password as input and checks its strength using `if-else` or `elif` statements. Consider factors like length, uppercase, lowercase, and symbols.

**5. Text Analyzer:**
   - Create a program that takes a text string as input and analyzes it using a `for` loop. Count the number of uppercase, lowercase, and whitespace characters.

**6. Word Counter:**
   - Write a program that takes a sentence as input and counts the number of words using a `for` loop. Split the sentence into words using `split()`.

**7. Number Guessing Game:**
   - Develop a guessing game where the user tries to guess a random number within a certain range. Use a `while` loop to keep asking for guesses until correct. Provide feedback using `if` statements.

**8. Name Case Converter:**
   - Write a program that takes a name as input and allows the user to choose between converting it to uppercase or lowercase using `if` statements.

**9. Simple Calculator:**
   - Create a basic calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (e.g., +, -, *, /) as input. Use `if` statements to perform the chosen operation and print the result.

**10. Temperature Converter:**
   - Write a program that takes a temperature value and a unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) as input. Convert the temperature between units using `if` statements and appropriate formulas. Consider uppercase/lowercase conversion for the unit input.

These questions encourage you to combine various control flow structures, string manipulation techniques, and user input handling in Python. Have fun practicing!
